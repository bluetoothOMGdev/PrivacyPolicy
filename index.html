					<p>BluetoothOMG is an Ad supported package of games. BluetoothOMG is provided by our team at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
					<p>BluetoothOMG is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our users. At BluetoothOMG, we build analytics into our games to help us to improve them to give the user the best possible game experience. This samples anonymous non-personal data that simply allows us to find out what users do and do not like. BluetoothOMG fully respects the user's privacy and never collects information that could be directly linked to the user. BluetoothOMG also displays advertisements to fund the creation of these games. This is all governed by the following privacy policy:</p>
					<p>Unless explicitly given the opportunity to accept this policy inside our app, please note that by using BluetoothOMG mobile application, you are agreeing to this privacy policy. If you do not agree to this privacy policy, please do not use or otherwise access our application.</p>

				<li><br/></li>
				<li class="header-small">
					<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is effective from 1st January 2020 and was enacted to provide California consumers with greater transparency and control over their personal information.</p>
					<p>BluetoothOMG, through using ads in our app, discloses limited user data to ad networks in order to provide users with targeted relevant ads. Under CCPA, this constitutes selling of personal information, and therefore we provide the required general opt out link in our games. Outside of disclosing this limited data to ad networks, BluetoothOMG does not sell any user personal information.</p>

				<li class="header-small">
					<p>BluetoothOMG may collect and use anonymous data, via Google Analytics (and Google Analytics for Firebase). We cannot identify you from this data. The data is pooled to give us general statistics on our audience and usage of our games.</p>
					<p>Google Analytics collects an app-instance identifier &mdash; a randomly generated number that identifies a unique installation of an App. Whenever a user resets their Advertising ID, the app-instance identifier is also reset.</p>
					<p>For example, Google Analytics automatically samples a user's country and city, chosen device language, device model and make, screen resolution, app version being used, operating system version, mobile phone network. This pooled data provides statistics that can help us determine, for example, where our games are being most commonly used, and on which devices. This can help us determine how to update our games going forward.</p>
					<p>Google Analytics also automatically collects data including app sessions numbers, session lengths, screen visits, flow from screen to screen, and app acquisition data (where a user came from to install an app). Alongside data that is automatically collected by Google Analytics, we also collect our own anonymous data on our app usage through Google Analytics. This includes game settings chosen, game results and other general UI events. Taken together, this data allows us to improve our games in many ways. Such data can also help us improve artwork in the game (by knowing what styles are most popular), or help us determine default option settings.</p>
					<p>None of this collected data can be linked to any individual, and it is pooled to provide us with general usage and audience statistics. BluetoothOMG reserves the right to use the collected anonymous data ourselves or disclose it to our partners.</p>

				<li><br/></li>
				<li class="header-small">
					<p>Some of our free games might now use Google&rsquo;s Firebase Crashlytics, which provides us with more detailed crash data in order to track down and fix problems in the games. This system provides us with details such as device type, Android version, time of crash, and crash logs. The crash reports are anonymous and no personally identifiable data is sent to us.</p>
