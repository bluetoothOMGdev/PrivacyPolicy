<p>BluetoothOMG Privacy Policy</p>

<p>BluetoothOMG is an Ad supported package of games. BluetoothOMG is provided by our team at no cost and is intended for use as is. BluetoothOMG is dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our users. At BluetoothOMG, we build analytics into our games to help us to improve them to give the user the best possible game experience. This samples anonymous non-personal data that simply allows us to find out what users do and do not like. BluetoothOMG fully respects the user's privacy and never collects information that could be directly linked to the user. BluetoothOMG also displays advertisements to fund the creation of these games. This is all governed by the following privacy policy: Unless explicitly given the opportunity to accept this policy inside an app, please note that by using BluetoothOMG mobile application, you are agreeing to this privacy policy. If you do not agree to this privacy policy, please do not use or otherwise access our application. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is effective from 1st January 2020 and was enacted to provide California consumers with greater transparency and control over their personal information. BluetoothOMG, through using ads in our app, discloses limited user data to ad networks in order to provide users with targeted relevant ads. Under CCPA, this constitutes selling of personal information, and therefore we provide the required general opt out link in our games. Outside of disclosing this limited data to ad networks, BluetoothOMG does not sell any user personal information. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) BluetoothOMG complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the U.S. and does not knowingly collect personal information about children. Anonymous Data BluetoothOMG may collect and use anonymous data, via Google Analytics (and Google Analytics for Firebase). We cannot identify you from this data. The data is pooled to give us general statistics on our audience and usage of our games. Google Analytics collects an app-instance identifier &mdash; a randomly generated number that identifies a unique installation of an App. Whenever a user resets their Advertising Identifier (Advertising ID on Android, and ID for Advertisers on iOS), the app-instance identifier is also reset. For example, Google Analytics automatically samples a user's country and city, chosen device language, device model and make, screen resolution, app version being used, operating system version, mobile phone network. This pooled data provides statistics that can help us determine, for example, where our games are being most commonly used, and on which devices. This can help us determine how to update our games going forward. Google Analytics also automatically collects data including app sessions numbers, session lengths, screen visits, flow from screen to screen, and app acquisition data (where a user came from to install an app). Alongside data that is automatically collected by Google Analytics, we also collect our own anonymous data on our app usage through Google Analytics. This includes game settings chosen, game results and other general UI events. Taken together, this data allows us to improve our games in many ways. Such data can also help us improve artwork in the game (by knowing what styles are most popular), or help us determine default option settings. We also collect data on which of our games are installed, so that we have a better idea of which games might be popular with users of another of our games. None of this collected data can be linked to any individual, and it is pooled to provide us with general usage and audience statistics. BluetoothOMG reserves the right to use the collected anonymous data ourselves or disclose it to our partners. Crashlytics Some of our free games might now use Google&rsquo;s Firebase Crashlytics, which provides us with more detailed crash data in order to track down and fix problems in the games. This system provides us with details such as device type, Android version, time of crash, and crash logs. The crash reports are anonymous and no personally identifiable data is sent to us. Third Party Terms and Conditions Please note that certain third parties, including but not limited to application stores, may be needed in order for you to access our mobile applications. These third parties have their own privacy policies which BluetoothOMG cannot control. Links to Third Party Sites or Games Our mobile games are supported by advertisements, which provide access to third party sites or apps. Our mobile games may provide access to third party social networking, communication and search features. Please be aware that, if you use any of these links you will leave our app and the page you go to will not be governed by our privacy policy. We cannot be responsible for the privacy of any information you provide whilst outside of our game. These third party sites or apps are not affiliated with or controlled by BluetoothOMG. BluetoothOMG are not responsible for their content or for the use of any information you may provide them.

Updates to this Policy We may revise our privacy policy from time to time. When we do, those changes will be reflected here (as accessed via our application). Any significant change we make to data usage will be drawn to your attention via our apps. We encourage you to review this privacy policy from time to time. Your continued use of our application will signify your acceptance of the changes to this privacy policy. latest update: 21st November 2020</p>
